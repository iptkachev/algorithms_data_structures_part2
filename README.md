# Algorithms methods: theory and practise. Data structures
This repository presents solved exercises from course:

1. Basic data structures: code brackets, tree height, emulating network packages
with stack, max value in window slicing
2. Priority queues and disjoint sets: building minheap, 
emulating parallel processing tasks, merging tables, system of variables
3. Binary search trees: traversals, check property of bst
4. Graph: dijkstra, prim's
